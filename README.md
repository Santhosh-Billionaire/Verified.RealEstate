### ✅ What to Do Next

1. Create a folder `assets/` in your project root or inside `public/`.
2. Rename and place the three images inside it:
   - `why-choose-us.png`
   - `featured-properties.png`
   - `certified-agents.png`
3. Update the image paths in the README if needed.

Let me know if you want me to generate this with actual base64 inline images instead, or prepare a separate `DETAILED_DOCUMENTATION.md`.
```
